Machine learning project - Happy Customer

Getting feedback from customers is not easy either, but we do our best to get constant feedback from our customers. This is a crucial function to improve our operations across all levels.

We recently did a survey to a select customer cohort. You are presented with a subset of this data. We will be using the remaining data as a private test set.

Data Description:

Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers
X1 = my order was delivered on time
X2 = contents of my order was as I expected
X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order
X4 = I paid a good price for my order
X5 = I am satisfied with my courier
X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me

Attributes X1 to X6 indicate the responses for each question and have values from 1 to 5 where the smaller number indicates less and the higher number indicates more towards the answer.

Goal(s):

Predict if a customer is happy or not based on the answers they give to questions asked.

Attempts:
In this project I use the following model: K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and Neural Network.

Result:
Random Forest Classification and Neural Network give the highest accuracy using 5-fold cross validation
